# Current Cryptocurrencies Prices

An app that allows you to track the current prices of the 5 most popular cryptocurrencies:

1. Bitcoin (BTC)
2. Ethereum (ETH)
3. Tether (USDT)
4. USD Coin (USDC)
5. BNB (BNB)

I used the free public API which doesn't require API keys or other type of authentication:
